# Week 1 Notes: Getting and Cleaning Data

## Obtaining Data Motivation

Purpose of the class is to both identify what tidy data looks like, and how one
can actually get there. Examples given include extracting data from multiple
structured environments, pulling raw data from a really complex flat data source,
or even importing data that it already nicely structured but in a format like
JSON.

Example Pipeline:
1. Raw Data
2. Processing Script
3. Tidy Data
4. Data Analysis
5. Data Communication

This course covers 1-3.

## Raw and Processed Data

> "Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to a set
> of items. -- Wikipedia"

Qualitative: Country of origin, sex, treatment
Quantitative: Height, weight, blood pressure

Raw: Original, hard to parse, needs processing
Processed: Ready for analysis, process is varied (merge, subset, transform, etc)

Nota bene: all steps should be recorded and reproducible.

## Components of Tidy Data




## Downloading Files


## Reading Local Files


## Reading Excel Files
